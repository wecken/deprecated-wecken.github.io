                    <h1>Role</h1>
                    <p>At Mercedes-Benz Research and Development, I was responsible for UI concepts (such as wireframes, and information architecture) of the brand's GPS navigation system. The product is called <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/a-class/com/en/mbux/" target="_blank">MBUX</a>. See more about it on the link.</p>
                    <h1>Challenges</h1>
                    <p>When I joinded the company, the product was catastropic. Even in the production release, the entire system constantly kept crashing, which, as a matter of course, resulted a number of customer complaints. </p>
                    <p>First, I had to find out why that situation was happening. </p>
                    <p>The biggest problem I found was too many "Japan-specific" features. Due to historical reason, Japanese GPS navigation system evoloved in peculiar way. Therefore, the product and the process of development have been so much complicated. I had to align the Japan-specifi UI to global UI</p>
                    <h1>Design Strategy</h1>
                    <p>I asked myself <b>"are those Japan-specific features really necessary?"</b>. To find out, I conducted an online survey. I asked Japanese users how often they user such conventional features. As a result, I found a lot of those features were not used anymore. Therefore, I reduced a number of those over-localized features.</p>
                    <p>This resulted significant improvements of system stability, and it allowed me to import many advanced features that were standard in other countries. </p>

                    <h1>Achievements</h1>
                    <p>Previous generation was featuring address input method where user had to choose destination address step by step from state to street number. This feature was unique to Japanese market. However, this method was ineficient. It took about 90 seconds to input average Japanese address.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I redesigned the interaction flow so user can immediately start typing the destination, which accepts many types of keywords like address, POI name, POI category, POI phone number, and ZIP code, using software keyboard. </p>
                    <p>With the new concept I designed, it took just 10 seconds to complete the same address, making it 9 times faster than previous generation. </p>
                    <p>Because the keyboard allows voice input as well, user can input the address even safer and faster while driving. </p>

                    <p>After research including internal / external survey, I concluded that '10 key flick Japanese input method' is a 'must have' feature. </p>
                    <p>Therefore, I redesigned software keyboard so it matches today's user expectation.</p>

                    <h1>Role</h1>
                    <p>In <a href="https://castalia.co.jp/en/" target="_blank">Castalia Co., Ltd.</a> I was responsible for Project Management, and UI/UX Design for OEM development. This project was to redesign the iOS/Android dictionary app called "<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/%E8%8B%B1%E8%BE%9E%E9%83%8E-on-the-web-%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%82%AF/id365874160?mt=8" target="_blank">Eijiro (英辞郎) on the Web</a>", which is one of the most popular web dictionary in Japan.</p>
                    <h1>Challenges</h1>
                    <p>Before I redesigned it, there were too many screen transitions. Because the app is famous for the amount of example sentenses, I wanted the app to be more efficient when user is searching for a best suitable result from many of those. </p>
                    <h1>Design Strategy</h1>
                    <p>I wanted to have fluent animation to realize efficient interaction between master and detail views. Because of animated transition, user won't feel getting lost as a result of the interaction. </p>
                    <h1>Achievements</h1>
                    <p>The app is getting high user review on the App Store and Google Play store despite the fact that it's been more than 3 years since it was released.</p>

                    <h1>Role</h1>
                    <p>Another project I worked on at Castalia was called <a href="https://www.gooc.us/" target="_blank">Goocus</a>.</p>
                    <p>I was fully responsible for its UI design, including web sites.</p>
                    <h1>Challenges</h1>
                    <p>Even though there are so many online courses, and a lot of them are free, it's not so easy to motivate ourselves to keep learning. We set this problem as what we solve.</p>
                    <h1>Design Strategy</h1>
                    <p>To solve our challenges, I included a lot of "gamification" techniques such as ranking, commenting, personalized notifications, sound effects, etc. </p>
                    <h1>Achievements</h1>
                    <p>Goocus is used as a platform for distributing online courses by various companies, and getting great feedback from them. </p>
